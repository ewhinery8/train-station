# Types:
#   feat:     A new feature
#   fix:      A bug fix
#   docs:     Documentation only changes
#   perf:     Performance improvements
#   refactor: Code refactoring
#   test:     Adding missing tests
#   chore:    Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
#
# Branch naming should match commit type:
#   feat/ → feat: commits
#   fix/  → fix: commits
#   perf/ → perf: commits
#   docs/ → docs: commits
#   refactor/ → refactor: commits
#   test/ → test: commits
#   chore/ → chore: commits
#
# Examples:
#   feat: add matrix multiplication with SIMD optimization
#   fix: resolve memory leak in tensor allocation
#   perf: optimize broadcasting operations by 40%
#   docs: update API documentation for autograd system
#   refactor: simplify gradient computation logic
#   test: add comprehensive validation for CUDA operations
#   chore: bump version to 0.1.4
#
# Guidelines:
#   - Use present tense ("add" not "added")
#   - Don't capitalize first letter of description
#   - No period at the end of description
#   - Include performance impact in perf commits when measurable
#   - Reference issues in footer if applicable
