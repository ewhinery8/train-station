//! Broadcasting utilities for tensor operations
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive broadcasting functionality for element-wise operations
//! following NumPy broadcasting semantics. Broadcasting enables operations between tensors
//! of different shapes by automatically expanding dimensions to make them compatible.
//!
//! # Key Features
//!
//! - **NumPy Compatible**: Follows NumPy broadcasting semantics precisely
//! - **Zero-Copy Views**: Creates efficient views when possible
//! - **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory allocations during broadcasting
//! - **SIMD Optimized**: Optimized paths for common broadcasting patterns
//! - **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for incompatible shapes
//! - **Performance Optimized**: Fast paths for common ML broadcasting patterns
//!
//! # Broadcasting Rules
//!
//! 1. Dimensions are aligned from the rightmost (trailing) dimension
//! 2. Dimensions are compatible if they are equal, or one of them is 1
//! 3. Missing dimensions are treated as 1
//! 4. The result shape is the element-wise maximum of input shapes
//!
//! # Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **Shape Computation**: O(max_rank) time complexity
//! - **Memory Usage**: O(1) for view creation, O(n) only when copying needed
//! - **SIMD Ready**: Maintains alignment for vectorized operations
//! - **Cache Friendly**: Optimized memory access patterns
//! - **Optimized Patterns**: Fast paths for scalar and vector-matrix broadcasting
//!
//! # Implementation Details
//!
//! The broadcasting system provides multiple specialized implementations:
//!
//! - **Shape Computation**: Efficient broadcast shape calculation with error handling
//! - **Stride Optimization**: Zero-copy broadcasting using stride manipulation
//! - **SIMD Broadcasting**: AVX2-optimized scalar broadcasting for maximum performance
//! - **Memory Management**: Efficient copying with minimal allocations
//! - **Optimized Patterns**: Fast paths for common neural network broadcasting scenarios

    /// * `vector` - 1D tensor to broadcast
    /// * `rows` - Number of rows in the target matrix
    /// * `cols` - Number of columns in the target matrix
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A new 2D tensor with the vector replicated across all rows
    ///
    /// # Implementation Details
    ///
    /// - **Row-wise Copying**: Efficiently copies the vector to each row
    /// - **Memory Layout**: Optimized for cache-friendly access patterns
    /// - **Validation**: Ensures vector size matches matrix columns
